Books I’ve Read: If Cats Disappeared from the World by Genki Kawamura (세상에서 고양이가 사라진다면)

A man dying of a brain tumor makes a deal with the devil to live an extra day by erasing something from the world. (He starts with phones.) Good premise. Some parts were bullshit, like when he thinks, “Why do we need names for individual flowers or people? Cats just call them all the same thing. It’s just humans pushing their will on nature. Why can’t we be more like cats?” Fuck off. We need to name things so we can communicate with each other. You’re not being deep, you’re being a dumbass.

Also, it gets a bit overly sentimental with the whole “live each day as if it were your last” garbage, but overall I liked it. It was short and I finished it in two sittings. 
The movie is FUCKING UNWATCHABLE though. Don’t even bother.
