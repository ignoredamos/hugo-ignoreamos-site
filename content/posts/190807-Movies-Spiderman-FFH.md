### Movies I’ve Seen: Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019) directed by Jon Watts

Actually better than the first one, “Homecoming”, which I FUCKING HATED. Action is ok but about 60% of the movie is still annoying high school bullshit. And now this bullshit is a disturbing love story between Spider-man’s sidekick, Diabetos, and his new girlfriend, that girl from the “Boom Boom Boom Now let me hear you say Way Ho” meme.

### <p>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734; 2 out of 5</p>

Not bad, but can’t be “a recommend” to anyone. Doesn’t add anything to “Phase 4” of the MCU and can be skipped. Unless I missed some bullshit after credits garbage. (Ok, I just looked it up. Nah, I still don’t fucking care.) Just an OK, dumb superhero movie.

### SPOILERS BELOW:

OK. everyone knew who the bad guy would be when the first trailer came out, regardless of what Mysterio is in the comics. But there is this scene in the middle where Jake Gyllenhaall just goes on a 15 minute long exposition dump and explains that he worked for Tony Stark and went evil because Stark took credit for his hologram tech. Then he talks about how hard it was to convince Nick Fury that he was a good guy from another dimension because of how paranoid Fury is.

SO PARANOID that he didn’t notice that this guy WORKED for TONY STARK? SO PARANOID he didn’t even try to confirm if this story was true or not? Oh don’t worry, that’s explained because Mysterio has a guy who’s REALLY good at coming up with stories on his team. Fuck off.

Also, he takes control of drones that can literally kill anyone, anywhere in the world in like 30 seconds without them noticing, but waits like 2 days to send them after the kids who knew his true identity.
