Directed by William Goldman

A magician incorporates ventriloquism into his act and... yeah... he's crazy and the dummy starts killing people.

Goldman adapted his novel into a screenplay for the 1978 movie starring Anthony Hopkins, Ann-Margret, and Burgess Meredith. It was directed by Richard Attenborough who was the old man from Jurassic Park.

The movie cuts out a lot of pointless bullshit from the book. There was this story about the main character's father watching some football game that went nowhere. Goldman's editor wanted him to take it out of the novel but Goldman refused because it was a true story that happened to him. I guess he realized how wrong he was when writing the movie.
