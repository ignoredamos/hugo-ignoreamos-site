Books I've Read: The Wisdom of Insecurity: A Message for an Age of Anxiety by Alan Watts (1951)

Why were we born as creatures with such dreams and hopes when the end is always the same?

Whenever I read one of these books about eastern spirituality it always has the exact opposite intended effect. I get SUPER fucking angry and annoyed. "We cannot know our feelings because if we think of how we feel, that feeling is already in the past. There is no present. There is no separation between 'I' and 'Me'" Holy shit. Get to the point, hippy!

I was really struggling to stick with this all the way so I tried reading it out loud. Apparently, that's supposed to improve focus and retention. Well, I did finish and there are parts that are really beautiful, but I just wanted it all to end. 

### Rating: I didn't think it was too "groovy"
