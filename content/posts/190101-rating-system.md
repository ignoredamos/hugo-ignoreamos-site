Abysmal. Terrible. Garbage. Something that has no value and that is not only bad, but elicits a reaction of anger for having wasted your time.

Just bad. But also for movies that commit the sin of being boring or forgettable.

Bad but may have some redeeming qualities. A good joke here and there. Some good action scenes, but still can’t be recommended. Maybe alright for someone invested in a series or a fan of the genre, but still completely skippable.

Solid recommend. Won’t be a waste of time to see it at the cinema.

Fantastic. Should be seen by anyone regardless of taste. Memorable and instills some great emotion whether it be laughter, sadness, or shock.

Transcendent. A movie that is not only good but adds something to the art form itself.
